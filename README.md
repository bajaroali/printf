#_printf

This is the first alx team project.

This printf project recreates the standard printf function from scratch in C

##Function

The purpose of the _printf is to mimic printf from stdio.h.

The prototype we used is "int _printf(const char *format, ...)" where format is a string and takes unlimited number of inputs as values. Returns number of chars printed.

write output to stdout, the standard output stream format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives.
Project Done by Robert Mukiibi and Bajaro Ali Iddi.
